This directory holds public keys for our partners who need to be able to sign and verify files for one reason or another.
We convert these to c++ headers to embed them into Unity.

The process for doing this: 
 * Generate the header: $(TOP)/Tools/Build/DumpBinaryToHeader.pl partnerkey.pub
 * Add the new header to PublicKeys.h
 * Commit BOTH the key and the header: hg add partnerkey.pub partnerkey.h; hg commit
